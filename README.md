# Machine-Learning-for-Stroke-Risk
# Stroke is said to be a blocked artery (ischemic stroke) or leaking or bursting of a blood vessel.
# In this project we tried to look at the various assumed causes and underlying health conditions that are believed to be catalyst to Stoke.
# We did not loose fact of environmental and exogenous factors that may also aggravate the condition, like Gender, Age,work type and marriage.
# Resources was sourced from Kaggle web site, a known repository for data and information.
# A number of variables were considered as direct and remote causes of stoke. We used various machine learning algorithms to establish
# correlation between these variables with the subject matter.
# The work utilised the primary tools of machine learning which is, observation to build models,then use the models to make predictions.
# The work is divided into different sections and sub-heads
# section (1): the necessary libraries for machine learning were imported.
# section (2): we imported the CSV data files to be used in the analysis.The information essentially relates to the likely causation variables which are under consideration.
# Section (3): Data Preparation, which basically dealt with data clean-up to generate relevant data and information.
# Data Visualisation. Here we tried to present our data/information with alternative visual tools for a better appreciation of information.eg ....
# Section (4) Feature Engineering, this can be litarally seen as the process that takes raw data and transforms it into features thatcan be used to create
# a predictive model using machine learning or statistical modeling. This section explored this technique to establish relationship and make prediction.
# Section (5)Dived into Machine learning proper and extrapolated relevant informations for training and testing. A number of machine learning
# techniques were used, eg Unsupervised learning, Linear Regression, Supervised learning and Nuaral net work. Also a number of boasters were adopted in the
# process as it relates the various techniques eg, KNN and Decision tree for unsupervised learning, Random forest classifier and support vector
# Classifier for Supervised learning.
# Nuaral net work was used as a concluding method, it showed a reasonable level of precision and prediction @ 93%. A reasonsonable number of statistical
# Tools were employed in our analysis.
# Section(6) This is the concluding part with different visualization tools on display to drive the reserch findings home.
